"""
Tool handlers package.

Importing this package is the side-effect that populates
`_registry.HANDLERS`. Each submodule registers its tools via the
`@register("twincat_...")` decorator at module scope, so simply importing
them registers every handler.

`server.call_tool()` imports `HANDLERS` and dispatches by name.
