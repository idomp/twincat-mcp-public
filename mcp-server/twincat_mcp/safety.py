"""
Safety / arming layer for destructive tools.

Dangerous tools (activate, restart, deploy, set_state, write_var) require
the server to be "armed" before they run. Arming auto-expires after
`ARMED_MODE_TTL` seconds of inactivity — every successful armed-tool
call resets the countdown, so an active session is effectively
unbounded while an idle one disarms itself.

The most destructive subset (activate, restart, deploy) additionally
require an explicit `confirm: "CONFIRM"` argument on each call.

Everything in this module is module-level state + pure functions; it does
not depend on the shell host or any tool handler. The behavior is
identical to what used to live at the top of server.py.
